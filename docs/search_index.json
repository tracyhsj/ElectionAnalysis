Since crime statistics may differ from the years prior to the pandemic, we will explore the most recent shooting incidents in NYC. Through various data visualization techniques, we hope to answer the following questions that we are interested in studying: 1. The Number of Shooting Incidents With Respect To Month (Line Chart with LOESS Smoother) 2. The Ratio of Death in the Shooting Incidents With Respect to Hours In a Day. (Stacked Bar Chart) 3. The Relationship Between the Month and Boroughs of Shooting Incidents (Line Chart &amp; Stacked Histogram) 4. The Ratio of Death With Respect To The Specific Location of The Shooting Incidents (Cleveland dot plot) 5. The Ratio of Death For The Shooting Incidents In Each Borough (Stacked Bar Chart) 6. The Number of Shooting Incidents With Respect to the Precincts. (Map) 7. The Correlation Between Different Boroughs and the Victims/Perpetrators. (Histogram + facet) 8. The Contrast Between Perpetrators’ Age vs Victims’ Age. (Population Pyramid) 9. The Visualization of the Victims’ Characteristics. (Mirror Chart + facet &amp; Alluvial Chart) 10. The Visualization of the Perpetrators’ Characteristics (PERP_AGE_GROUP, PERP_SEX, and PERP_RACE).

The consecutive murder incidents that happened this summer and the shooting in the East Village right after the Fall semester starts caused panic among the citizens. Public safety has always been a concern, especially for the ones who just moved to New York City. Though these shooting incidents seem to be random at first glance, data analysis and visualization help reveal the hidden correlation and provide hints about public safety concerns. The New York Police Department records reported crimes and releases data sets related to police enforcement and criminal activity, aiming to increase transparency and foster collaboration. With the data provided by NYPD, we are interested in the citywide crime statistics, specifically shooting incidents in 2022. It is worth studying these up-to-date shooting incidents when living in NYC, thereby we can have a clear picture of the crimes around us to avoid possible dangers. Specifically, we are interested in questions relating to the characteristics of victims and suspects, and the possible correlation between the victims/suspects’ characteristics with respect to the incident’s geography or occurrence time. 2.2 Data availability The datasource of this project is from the data published and maintained by the New York Police Department. There were many other data sources that we considered when deciding to analyze crime-related information about New York City, however, the New York Police Department is the most reliable source as their data is collected based on the reported crimes they record. Therefore, we considered collecting the citywide crime data directly released by the New York Police Department. NYPD provides quarterly-updated crime incident datasets such as arrest and complaint, among which we are most interested in and therefore decide to analyze the shooting incidents this year. We may also consider referring to statistics of other crimes or shootings in former years for comparison. The New York Police Department provides the shooting incidents data in multiple formats on their official website, among these formats, we found csv to be the most convenient to be analyzed in R. The next steps would be importing the data from the NYPD website and performing data pre-processing such as combining datasets and cleaning by using either Python or R. Overall, the data is reliable and of good quality. However, there are null values for certain columns, for example, LOCATION_DESC and information about the perpetrator like PERP_AGE_GROUP and PERP_SEX. Though the missing information about the perpetrators is understandable as the police may not be able to arrest the perpetrator in the crime scene, we will check these missing values specifically with a missing value analysis. We will pay special consideration regarding missing values in different situations in our project, for some tasks we may need to neglect these missing values as the information is not provided to us, while for some tasks about the perpetrator we may regard these missing values as a separate group and perform analysis on this group. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources The source of this data set is the New York Police Department(NYPD), which is responsible for collecting and maintaining the data. It is manually collected by the police in each shooting incident that occurred in NYC during the current calendar year, extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website. There are several data sets relating to crimes in NYC with different time range on the NYPD website, for example, the Incident Level Arrest Data (2013-now) and City Wide Crime Statistics Weekly. We chose the year-to-date Shooting Incident Data because shooting incidents are one of the most fatal crimes but it is also one that happens frequently in NYC, it is worth investigating the correlation and implication behind this data. And since the outbreak of the pandemic, crime statistics may differ from the previous years, therefore we are interested in the most recent year’s data. This shooting incident data set contains 21 features as its columns, including the occurrence date, the STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG which is the result of the incident, information related to suspect and victim demographics, and the age, gender, and race of both suspect and victim. There is also rich information about each incident, such as the specific time, latitude and longitude of the incident, the location of occurrence like inside or outside, the borough and precinct, and the location classification category like housing or street. This data set covers almost all types of variables, such as categorical, time series, and spatial-temporal, with data types like plain text, data time, and number. There are 1400 rows and each row is a record of a shooting incident. At first glance, we noticed that there are many missing values in this data set, especially in the columns about the perpetrator and the location of the incidents. We further investigate this in our missing value analysis to see if the missing values will affect the analysis, and we will also take action on these missing values when appropriate during our data visualization. Moreover, the empty cells are denoted as a string “(null)” in this data set, therefore our first step is to transform this data set into the correct format. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation This data set is organized and does not contain a lot of mal-formatted values. Though data transformation is required for most of the graphs in the analysis process, in the preliminary stage, the only transformation needs to be done on the whole data set is to adjust the null values. The original data set uses “(null)” with character type to represent the NAs, therefore when loading the data set, all “(null)” values were transformed into the empty string NA. 3.3 Missing value analysis ## LOCATION_DESC PERP_AGE_GROUP PERP_SEX ## 809 563 563 ## PERP_RACE LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC Latitude ## 563 18 6 ## Longitude VIC_SEX VIC_AGE_GROUP ## 6 2 1 ## VIC_RACE INCIDENT_KEY OCCUR_DATE ## 1 0 0 ## OCCUR_TIME BORO LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC ## 0 0 0 ## PRECINCT JURISDICTION_CODE STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG ## 0 0 0 ## X_COORD_CD Y_COORD_CD New.Georeferenced.Column ## 0 0 0 We first plot the missing value chart to check the missing values column-wise, along with a summary that clarify the specific number of missing values in each column. As only 7 columns out of the 21 columns contain missing value, we extract these columns to proceed further into the next step of missing value analysis. We then explore the missing patterns in this data set, which refer to the combination of columns missing. The variables are abbreviated to prevent the axis labels from overlapping with each other. The top part of this graph shows the percentage of missing values in each column, and notice that loc, which stands for LOCATION_DESC, has more than 50% of its value being missing. This may due to the fact there are two columns representing the location, and LOCATION_DESC is a subcategory of LOC_CLASSFCTION(loc_class), so that it may be left empty since it is too specific and redundant, recording either of them is enough information for representing the location. The middle part of the graph presents the missing patterns and the right part shows the percentage for each missing patterns. While loc alone is the highest among all 9 patterns, the pattern (loc + loc_class) has the lowest percentage of rows missing, which reinforces the hypothesis that loc is left empty for most cases as either of loc or loc_class contains enough information for the location of the incidents, so that the case that both are missing is rare. Also notice that 4 out of the 7 missing columns are about the location of the incident, the other 3 columns are all about the information of the perpetrator, and the pattern (p_age, p_sex, p_race) ranks the third for the percentage of rows. This shows that sometimes the perpetrator is able to escape from the crime scene, leaving with no record to the police, which is a strong contrast to the victims’ data since no victim’s information is missing in this data set. From the above missing value analysis, we figure out that these missing values won’t create a huge impact on our data analysis, since either missing values are unnecessary and backed up by other information, or it is inevitable in nature that the source of this data is not able to provide the record. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 The Victims/Perpetrators’ Characteristics 4.2 Visualization Relating to Incidents Demographics 4.3 Visualization Relating to Incidents Date Time 4.4 Summary of Results:", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 The Victims/Perpetrators’ Characteristics 4.1.1 The Contrast Between Perpetrators’ Age vs Victims’ Age (Population Pyramid): Note: In order to present the age groups in its order, this pyramid is not sorted based on the population(count) From this graph, it is obvious that the age group 25-44 ranks first in the number of both perpetrators and victims. However, it is also worth noticing that the number of teenage perpetrators(age &lt; 24) is more than that of the teenage victims, whereas this difference is reversed for the age groups above 25, so that there are more victims than perpetrators for ages above 25, especially for ages above 45. Thus speaking of the age group distribution, perpetrators are younger than the victims. 4.1.2 The Visualization of the Victims’ Characteristics (Mirror Chart): From the mirror chart above, among all the victims, Black has the highest number of victims in terms of race, while the age group 25-44 ranks top among all races except for White. Most of the victims are male, but there are female victims across almost all age groups and all races except for Asian/Pacific Islander. 4.1.3 Victims’ Characteristics Alternative (Alluvial Chart) Similar to the previous findings, male victims are a lot more than female victims. Most of them are within 18-24 and 25-44 age groups, which are young adults and mid-age people. Black people are the majority races, followed by Hispanics. White, Asian and other race are the minorities in terms of victims. 4.1.4 The Visualization of the Perpetrators’ Characteristics (PERP_AGE_GROUP, PERP_SEX, and PERP_RACE). (Spine Plot) ## PERP_RACE freq ## 1 ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER 12 ## 2 BLACK 584 ## 3 BLACK HISPANIC 88 ## 4 WHITE 10 ## 5 WHITE HISPANIC 143 ## 6 &lt;NA&gt; 563 Note: To make the overlapped labels readable, (B,WH,BH,A/PI,W) on the y-axis are the abbreviations for “BLACK”, “WHITE HISPANIC”, “BLACK HISPANIC”, “ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER”, “WHITE”. We have combined as many ways as we can think of to stop the labels from overlapping but this is the best we can get. There are significantly more male perpetrators than female perpetrators, with 25-44 ranks first in terms of age group and Black in terms of race. There is also a correlation with the former graph of the victims in terms of the rank of age group and race. 4.2 Visualization Relating to Incidents Demographics 4.2.1 The Number of Shooting Incidents With Respect to the Precincts (Map): Referring to the map of NYC, Precinct 44 is the Bronx, Precinct 75 is East New York, and Precinct 73 is Brownsville, the three areas where most shooting incidents occurred this year. 4.2.2 The Correlation Between Different Boroughs and the Victims/Perpetrators. (Histogram + facet) In general, Brooklyn and Manhattan are the boroughs where most shooting incidents occurred. Most of the perpetrators and victims are under the age group 25-44 in all boroughs, however, there are more teenage perpetrators (18-24) in some of the boroughs like the Bronx, while the number of victims under the age group 25-44 is much higher than that of perpetrators in the Bronx. The distribution of the graphs between perpetrator and victim are highly correlated, except for the boroughs of the Bronx and Queens. 4.2.3 The Ratio of Death For The Shooting Incidents In Each Borough (Stacked Bar Chart) Bronx and Brooklyn are where most shooting incidents happened, while Bronx has higher death rates than Brooklyn. Manhattan and Queens are similar and relatively safer than the former two Boroughs, having about half less shooting incidents reported. Among all five boroughs, Staten Island is the safest in terms of the total number of shooting incidents. 4.2.4 The Ratio of Death With Respect To The Location of The Shooting Incidents (Cleveland dot plot) By plotting the shooting incidents against descriptive locations, we noticed that for most locations the number of incidents resulting in the death of the victim is lower than that of the victim survived, however, for places like beauty/nail salon, social club, bar, and liquor store, this situation is reversed that there are more death cases. 4.3 Visualization Relating to Incidents Date Time 4.3.1 The Ratio of Death in the Shooting Incidents With Respect to Hours In a Day. (Stacked Bar Chart) We can observe that shooting incidents have a clear drop between 5:00AM ~ 1:00PM, while the high shooting incident frequency starting around 7:00PM, it reaches peak around 10:00PM. The death cases went up as number of shooting incidents are reported, death rate are not very related to the time of shooting incident happened, however, it is still higher in the evening than daytime. 4.3.2 The Number of Shooting Incidents With Respect To Month (Line Chart with LOESS Smoother) From the above graph it is obvious that the number of shooting incidents peaks at July, and there is a general trend that starting from January 2022, the number of incidents went up and reached the peak, then it slightly went down until October, which is the last released time of this data set. 4.3.3 The Relationship Between the Month and Boroughs of Shooting Incidents (Line Chart) Alternative (Stacked Histogram) The above two graphs visualized the number of shooting incidents in the five boroughs by weeks in the past 3 quarters. From the line chart we noticed that Brooklyn’s incidents peaks at April, but the total number of incidents in all five boroughs peaks at July as shown by the stacked histogram. 4.4 Summary of Results: In this analysis of the most recent shooting incidents in NYC, we found out that East New York, the Bronx, and Brownsville are the most dangerous areas in New York City in terms of the number of shooting incidents. And black males with age between 25 and 44 are the most vulnerable, as this group of people has the highest number of victims in these incidents. In general, perpetrator tends to be younger than the victims, and the age group 25-44 ranks first in both the number of perpetrators and the number of victims across all boroughs. For college students (aged between 18-24) in NYC, Brooklyn is the most dangerous borough as it has the highest number of victims under this age group. And though in general apartment building has the highest number of shooting incidents, places like Beauty/nail salon, social club, liquor store, and bar have a higher death rate. Speaking of time of the occurrence, July is when the number of shooting incidents peak so far this year, while the trend is decreasing since July. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component In this part, we provides two interactive plots in order to further explore our data more conveniently. In previous plots, we observed shooting incident weekly counts as the data appears narrowed for a large time range. In the first plot, we can use interactive tools to zoom in on selected time range, so that we can observe the day-to-day change of shooting incident numbers, and observe the overall trend at the same time. We can also explore the distribution of shooting incident at the time of day, with variation of victim’s age range and within the selected window of dates. By using the slider in the second plot, we can change the range of month selected, thus we can observe the change in distribution. In the dropdown menu, we can select the age range of victim. It is set to ‘All’, which means all data were selected by default. By changing the selection, we can explore the distribution based on different victim characteristics; and we can set it back to default at any time. For instance, by selecting “65+” we can observe only a small amount of incidents happened and they all distributed in the evening, which are statistically understandable. svg { font-family: sans-serif; } rect.overlay { stroke: black; } rect.selection { stroke: none; fill: steelblue; fill-opacity: 0.6; } #labelleft, #labelright { dominant-baseline: hanging; font-size: 12px; } #labelleft { text-anchor: end; } #labelright { text-anchor: start; } Victim age range: "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion During this process of data analysis, we explored various techniques to visualize the shooting incidents data in New York City and discovered some key findings. We found out that, as expected, there are more male perpetrators/victims than females, and most of the perpetrators or victims are under the age group 25-44. However, we also found out surprisingly that the perpetrators are slightly younger than the victims, meaning that there might be perpetrators targeting older people. As for geography, most shooting incidents occurred in Brooklyn, with the next being the Bronx. And though in general apartment building has the highest number of shooting incidents, places like Beauty/nail salon, social club, liquor store, and bar have a higher death rate. Speaking of time of the occurrence, July is when the number of shooting incidents peak so far this year, while the trend is decreasing since July. The main limitation of this project is due to the absence of continuous variables in the original data set, even though we tried our best to mutate the data set to get some continuous variables, like the frequency and percentage, however, it still prevents us from using some of the plots for multidimensional continuous variables. Another minor limitation that does not harm the goal of this project but may cause some difficulty to the audience is the large number of rows and columns, which makes the labels on some graphs overlap each other. To overcome this, we adjusted the labels in various ways, like rotating and abbreviating the labels while scaling the axis and hiding the repeating labels, but they still overlap, for example, on the mosaic plot. And abbreviating the labels is not intuitive for interpretation. For future directions, since this is an up-to-date data set that is still updating, it would be helpful to build an API to obtain new shooting incident records and automatically update these visualizations, and publish as a public website for those who may be interested in this topic to view. The data can be stored in a database or put on the cloud, so that every time a shooting incident record is released by the NYPD, the API will be triggered to insert this record into the database. The lesson learned from this exploration is the wide range of possible graphs that we can choose for all types of variables, while most are documented and presented by the professor in class, we also had some research to explore more possible graphs, like the mirror chart and population pyramid, and finding out how some basic graphs, like the bar chart, may be transformed into a visually different graph.
